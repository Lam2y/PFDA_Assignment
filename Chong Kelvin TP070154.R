#Objective: To investigate the relationship between Web Server and Encoding with Downtime

#Importing cleaned dataset.

#Analysis 2-1: Assess the impact of different web servers on downtime duration.

#Analysis 2-2: Explore whether encoding types are associated with longer downtime.

#Analysis 2-3: Examine the combined effect of web server and encoding on downtime.

#Analysis 2-4: Determine if specific web servers lead to consistently higher downtime duration regardless of encoding.

#Analysis 2-5: Investigate whether encoding changes within the same web server type impact downtime.
